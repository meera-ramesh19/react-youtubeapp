              I used to hate to carrying my 40lbs desktop downtown to 14 St Best
              Buy to be fix cause that was the only way without warranty. So, to
              save time and money I decided to learned about computer
              programming. The first code I wrote was 6 years ago in C+ during
              class assignment. As I tried to debugged my code, I kept getting
              an error message. It took me 15 hrs to realize I was missing a
              common. After getting my code to work and being frustrating and
              mortally defended by a common. The joy and excitement I felt for
              getting my code to work changed me. Along with not carrying my
              40lbs desktop to Best Buy to get it fix. Cause I prove to myself
              that I can fix my own problems if I know where to look. Which
              still to this day, I still use Best Buy. However, I am learning
              the ends and outs of computer programming.
